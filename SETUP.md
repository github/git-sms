git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-sms.git
cd git-sms
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File

Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add your credentials:

```env

# OpenAI

# GitHub authentication (optional, read-only)
# Only public read-only access is supported; write operations are disabled.
```
